(* Patterns. *)

(* OCaml does not have type casts within patterns, so we must produce
   well-typed patterns, and furthermore, if several patterns are
   type-compatible in Mezzo, then their OCaml counterparts must be
   type-compatible in OCaml. *)

(* The translation of [PConstruct] patterns is somewhat tricky. When there
   exist multiple tags (i.e., the pattern is refutable), we must translate it
   to a [PConstruct] pattern, because that is the only way of examining the
   tag within an OCaml pattern. When there exists just one tag, we could
   translate to a [PRecord] pattern; but, for simplicity, we will avoid
   distinguishing a special case. Now, in OCaml, data constructors carry
   anonymous fields, so we are forced to drop the field names and rely purely
   on field offsets. *)

(* For this translation to work, we will have to translate a Mezzo algebraic
   data type to a corresponding OCaml algebraic data type, with the same data
   constructors, same arity (plus one, for the adopter field), and use a
   distinct type variable as the type of each argument. *)
