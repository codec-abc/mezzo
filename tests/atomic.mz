(* This module could be useful in a sequential setting. In a
   concurrent setting, though, it is superseded by the modules
   [lock] and [wref] in the standard library. *)

(* A type of duplicable references with arbitrary (hence, possibly
   non-duplicable) content. *)

abstract ref a : type
fact duplicable (ref a)

(* Allocation. *)

val newref [a] (consumes x: a) : ref a =
  magic::magic [ref::ref a, ref a] (ref::newref x)

(* An atomic swap operation. *)

(* Only a weak update is sound, because the reference is duplicable. *)

(* In a sequential setting, this can be implemented using a read and
   a write. In a concurrent setting, this would require an atomic
   instruction. *)

val swap [a] (r: ref a, consumes x: a) : a =
  let r = magic::magic [ref a, ref::ref a] r in
  let y = r.contents in
  r.contents <- x;
  y

(* I would like to also offer a CAS instruction on atomic references,
   but CAS is useful only if we also have read. And we can't offer a
   read operation on these references (unless we restrict the content
   type to be duplicable). So I am not sure what to do. *)

(* Sequential locks. *)

(* TEMPORARY a type abbreviation would be useful here *)

(* A lock is implemented as an atomic reference to a Boolean. The
   value [true] means that the lock is free, hence the permission
   [p] is stored within the lock. The value [false] means that the
   lock is already taken, hence no permission is stored within the
   lock. *)

data lock (p : perm) =
  Lock { contents: ref (rich_bool empty p) }

(* Creation. *)

val newlock [p : perm] (| consumes p) : lock p =
  Lock { contents = newref [rich_bool empty p] True }

(* Acquisition. *)

val try_acquire [p : perm] (l: lock p) : rich_bool empty p =
  swap (l.contents, False)

val acquire [p : perm] (l: lock p) : (| p) =
  if not (try_acquire l) then
    (* Runtime failure: the lock is already taken! *)
    fail

(* Release. *)

val release [p : perm] (l: lock p | consumes p) : () =
  let _ = swap [(rich_bool empty p)] (l.contents, True) in
  (* We could use a [match] construct to check dynamically
     against multiple releases, but these are unlikely to
     occur, since multiple copies of [p] would be needed. *)
