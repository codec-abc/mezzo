open list

(* An iterator of type [iterator a post] allows enumerating a series of
   elements of type [a] (presumably the elements of some underlying
   collection) and, once stopped or finished, recovering the permission [post]
   (which typically represents the ownership of the underlying collection). *)

(* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

(* An outcome is information returned by the iterator to the client. *)

data outcome =
  | Stopped
  | Done

(* ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ *)

(* Concretely, an iterator is either: *)
data mutable iterator (i : value) a (post : perm) =

    (* finished, in which case the permission [post] is available, and the field
       [outcome] indicates whether the iteration was stopped or finished by iti; *)
    IFinished { outcome: outcome | post }

    (* or not finished, in which case an element [x] is available for inspection;
       this element is accompanied with two continuations, [stop] and [next]. Both
       of these continuations require an abstract permission [pre], only one copy
       of which is available, so the user is able to call [stop], or [next], but
       not both. (This is equivalent to a single continuation that takes a Boolean
       argument. We use two continuations because this allows [stop] and [next]
       to have distinct return types.) Furthermore, [stop] and [next] require the
       ownership of [x], so the element can be inspected, but cannot be retained. *)
