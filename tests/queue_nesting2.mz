open nest

(* A variant of the FIFO queue implementation, using nesting instead
   of adoption & abandon. *)

(* Cells now have two tags. A cell that is currently in the queue
   has tag [Cell]. A cell that is used to be in the queue, but has
   been extracted, has type [Garbage]. This is used to compensate
   for the fact that [f] cannot abandon a cell. *)

| Cell    { value_: a; next: (n: unknown | nests f (n @ cell f a)) }
| Garbage { value_: unknown; next: unknown }

(* TEMPORARY I would like the fifo object itself to adopt the cells,
   but this doesn't work, because an algebraic data type definition
   cannot refer to [this]. Instead I am forced to use a separate
   object, of type [region]. Furthermore, I am forced to use one
   field, which is a triple, whereas I would prefer to use three fields. *)
