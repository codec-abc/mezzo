val f [a] (id: a -> a) : () =
  fail

val g [a] (id: duplicable a => (a -> a | duplicable a)) : () =
  f id

(* this should fail because the actual argument passed to [f]
   does not have the desired type *)

(* this test is now rejected because implication is
   permitted only on top of a function type. I am
   keeping it around anyway, just in case. *)
