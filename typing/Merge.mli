(** This module implements the merge operation. *)

open TypeCore

type t = (env * var) * (var list * var list * var list)

(** When the control-flow diverges, one needs to merge the environments, that
 * is, compute a set of permissions that subsumes the two environments. In order
 * to run, the [merge_envs] function takes:
 * - a [top] environment which represents the original environment before the
 *   control-flow started to diverge,
 * - an optional type annotation which may contain a list of expected
 *   permissions to be available after this merge operation
 * - a pair of the left environment, and the variable that represents the return
 *   value computed in the left environment
 * - the same thing for the right environment.
 *
 * It returns a merged environment along with a variable that points to the
 * combined return value of the merged environment.
 *
 * Consider for example "if True then x else y"; the combined return value of
 * the two environments will try to reconcile the permissions available for "x"
 * and "y". *)
